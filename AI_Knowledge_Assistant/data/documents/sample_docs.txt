AI Knowledge Assistant Project Documentation

This project is an AI-powered Knowledge Assistant built using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
It allows users to ask natural language questions and receive accurate answers based on stored documents.

The system uses Endee as the vector database to store document embeddings and perform semantic search.
When a user submits a question, the system retrieves the most relevant document chunks from Endee
and passes them as context to a Large Language Model for answer generation.

Key Components of the System:
1. Document Loader – Loads and preprocesses text documents.
2. Embedding Generator – Converts text into vector embeddings.
3. Endee Vector Database – Stores and indexes embeddings.
4. Retriever – Finds relevant document chunks based on semantic similarity.
5. LLM Generator – Produces contextual answers using retrieved data.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves accuracy by grounding responses
in verified internal documents rather than relying only on model knowledge.

Use Case Examples:
- Question answering over internal documentation
- AI-powered student help desk
- Technical knowledge base search
- Internship or onboarding assistant

Endee is used to efficiently store high-dimensional embeddings and perform fast similarity search,
making it suitable for scalable AI knowledge systems.

This project demonstrates a real-world AI workflow involving document ingestion,
semantic retrieval, and natural language response generation.
