🚀 AI Knowledge Assistant
An intelligent AI-powered assistant that retrieves, understands, and answers user queries using advanced Natural Language Processing and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

This project combines the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with custom knowledge sources to provide accurate, context-aware, and human-like responses.

📌 Features
🔍 Smart Knowledge Retrieval – Fetches relevant information from custom datasets

🤖 LLM-based Responses – Uses advanced AI models for natural answers

🧠 Context Awareness – Maintains conversational context

📄 Document Processing – Supports PDFs / text / structured data

⚡ Fast Query Handling – Optimized retrieval for quick responses

🌐 User-Friendly Interface – Simple interaction via UI or CLI
